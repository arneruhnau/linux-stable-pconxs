* Solomon SSD1307 Framebuffer Driver

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "solomon,<chip>fb-<bus>". The only supported bus for
    now is i2c, and the supported chips are ssd1305, ssd1306 and ssd1307.
  - reg: Should contain address of the controller on the I2C bus. Most likely
         0x3c or 0x3d
  - pwm: Should contain the pwm to use according to the OF device tree PWM
         specification [0]. Only required for the ssd1307.
  - reset-gpios: Should contain the GPIO used to reset the OLED display
  - solomon,height: Height in pixel of the screen driven by the controller
  - solomon,width: Width in pixel of the screen driven by the controller

Optional properties:
  - reset-active-low: Is the reset gpio is active on physical low?
  - solomon,page-offset: Offset of pages (band of 8 pixels) that the screen is
    mapped to. Defaults to 1.
  - solomon,column-offset: Offset of columns that the screen is mapped to.
    Defaults to 0.
  - solomon,display-offset defaults to 0x20
  - solomon,com-pins-configuration defaults to 0x22
  - solomon,contrast defaults to 0x7F
  - solomon,segment-remap: If present configures segment remapping
